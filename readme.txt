Wordpress plugin that adds Cities and Zones from Guatemala to woocomerce. Spetially usefull for replacing the post code field, since guatemalans hardly use or know their post code.

== Description ==

This WooCommerce plugin transforms the text input for states, cities and postcode into pre-populated dropdowns with information of Guatemala locations.

This will be shown in checkout pages, edit addresses pages, shipping calculator, etc.

= Supported Countries =
 * Guatemala

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

WordPress 4.0  or greater
Woocommerce 5.9 or greater
PHP version 7.2 or greater
MySQL version 5.6 or greater

= Automatic installation =

- Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you donâ€™t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click `Add New`.
- Search for "Departamentos y Ciudades de Guatemala para Woocommerce", install and activate.
- Available [@Github](https://github.com/DigitalLabsAgcy/wp-p-woocommerce-guatemala).


= Manual installation =

[See wordpress codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation)


= Updating =


Automatic updates should work like a charm; as is the best practice, back up should be undertaken before updates.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.


This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Plugin Name screen to configure the plugin
4. (Make your instructions match the desired user flow for activating and installing your plugin. Include any steps that might be needed for explanatory purposes)


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
